npm run build
npm run dist-win-unpruned # for windows

## Install pre-built Electron app

## The UI

Starting the Bitfinex Honey UI will spawn all of the Bitfinex Honey services that are needed to register custom algo-order definitions in the background. Currently (as of release 1.0.0) the UI will register the built in default order types which will be instantly available for use in the bitfinex.com UI. For more info on how to use algo orders once the UI is running head [here](https://medium.com/bitfinex/announcing-the-honey-framework-algorithmic-orders-8065fb70c65c).
